An Empirical Analysis of the Efficacy of Different Sampling Techniques for Imbalanced Classification


## Synopsis

In this study, a comprehensive analysis of 26 popular sampling techniques was performed to understand their effectiveness in dealing with imbalanced data. Rigorous experiments have been conducted on 50 datasets with different degrees of imbalance to thoroughly investigate the performance of these techniques. A detailed discussion of the advantages and limitations of the techniques, as well as how to overcome such limitations, has been presented. Some critical factors that affect the sampling strategies have been identified and recommendations have been provided on how to choose an appropriate sampling technique for a particular application.
